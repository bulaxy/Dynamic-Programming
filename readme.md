## Purpose of this project

After reading and watching some dynamic programming articles and videos. Before looking at their final solution, I am going to try to solve the issue with using the original code and see whether we have similar solution! Of course, coding with my own style.

Meanwhile, improve the 2 pieces of code that being used in my other 2 repo-projects, which are [sudokuSolver](https://github.com/bulaxy/Simple-Sudoku-Bruteforcer/blob/main/sudokuSolver.js) from [sudoku Solver project](https://github.com/bulaxy/Simple-Sudoku-Bruteforcer) and [getDrawCombinations](https://github.com/bulaxy/ah-client/blob/master/src/contexts/ChaosBagContext.js) from my [ah-client project](https://github.com/bulaxy/ah-client). Both of them does not expect a massive improvement since the input of the recursive are rarely the same (grid state & bag state), but still fun to give it a try. Might add more as I go.
